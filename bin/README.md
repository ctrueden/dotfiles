This is my personal collection of scripts, some of which I use regularly,
and others of which are merely preserved for some semblance of posterity.

Most of these scripts were very quickly hacked together, do their jobs,
and nothing more. They should by no means be considered well-written,
well-structured, well-architected, polished, or any other adjective with
positive connotations.
