# This script exists mostly to be added to Startup Applications, in case I
# accidentally leave Zoom enabled (via Alt+Super+8) after I'm done using it,
# since the setting persists even after reboot.
#
# == Why? ==
# GNOME's Zoom accessibility feature is great for taking a closer look at
# parts of the desktop. Unfortunately, while it is enabled -- even when the
# magnification factor is at 1.0 -- GNOME's behavior becomes sluggish in
# various ways, such as mouse motion becoming choppy. More crucially, launching
# certain applications freezes the desktop UI for at least a second or two,
# sometimes many seconds and sometimes permanently. Affected applications for
# me include Firefox (installed via snap as per Ubuntu 24.04 default) and
# IntelliJ IDEA (installed into ~/.local via JetBrains Toolbox). Affected
# launch mechanisms include the Dash and the Show Apps screen; unaffected
# launch mechanisms include Alt+F2 and terminal-based execution.
