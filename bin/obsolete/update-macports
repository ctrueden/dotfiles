#

# Updates MacPorts to the latest version, upgrades all installed ports,
# cleans intermediate files and removes old port versions.
# Must be run as root.

# Thanks to: http://simenhag.blogspot.com/2008/11/cleaning-up-macports.html

# Note: I suggest using Homebrew rather than MacPorts:
# - Everything is installed cleanly into one place.
# - Everything is driven by Git, and you can add your own formulae.
