# be-nice - a script to make processes nicer by name instead of pid
#

# Eclipse constantly eats all my CPU, which causes Google Play Music to skip,
# since Chrome can't retain enough CPU cycles. This script allows you to tell
# an application to be nice by name. So in my case, I can say:
#
#     be-nice eclipse
#
# and it will automatically be reniced to +10. Music sounds good again!

ps="$(ps x)"
pid="$(echo "$ps" | grep "$@" | grep -v 'be-nice ' | sed -e 's/^ *//' | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"
echo "Renicing PID: $pid"
renice +10 -p "$pid"
