# Script to rotate wallpaper amongst all those installed.
# GNOME, why don't you have this feature built-in yet?

# Installed wallpapers typically go into ~/.local/share/backgrounds.
# And the active one is defined in GNOME settings by:
#
#   gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri
#
# We can update it via:
#
#   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \
#   'file:///home/curtis/.local/share/backgrounds/the-wallpaper-we-want.jpg'
#
# To make it run automatically, install it into your user crontab:
#
#   crontab -l >my-crontab
#   echo "*/5 * * * * $DOTFILES/bin/random-wallpaper" >my-crontab
#   crontab my-crontab
#   rm my-crontab

error() { >&2 echo '[ERROR]' $@; }
die() { error $@; exit 1; }

# Get the current wallpaper.
wallpaper=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri)
test "$wallpaper" || die "Cannot glean current wallpaper."

test -z "$DEBUG" || printf "current wallpaper URL: %s\n" "$wallpaper"

# Extract the directory path from the currently set wallpaper.
dir=${wallpaper#\'file://}
dir=${dir%/*}
test "$dir" || die "Cannot glean wallpaper directory."
test -d "$dir" || die "Invalid wallpaper directory: $dir"

test -z "$DEBUG" || printf "wallpaper directory: %s\n" "$dir"

# Choose a random new wallpaper from that same directory.
wallpaper=$(find "$dir" -type f | shuf | head -n1)

test -z "$DEBUG" || printf "new wallpaper -> %s\n" "$wallpaper"

# Update the current wallpaper accordingly.
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "file://$wallpaper"
